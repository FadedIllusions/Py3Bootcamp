# Py3Bootcamp

This repo houses an exhibition of the skills I acquired via [*Colt Steele's*](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) course on [*Udemy*](http://www.udemy.com/) entitled [*"The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp"*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/).

In examining the source code, you'll notice many working examples, progressions, and alternate ways commented out. (Feel free to uncomment and run.) I've, also, attempted to add in extra notes where needed/applicable.

Wherein I attempt to be quite thorough in my code, I do still highly recommend actually taking the course yourself. Colt Steele is quite an instructor and has spent a good bit of his time creating such an inclusive course, within which you'll glean a much deeper understanding than by merely perusing/running the following source code.
